  A HUNTER who had lassoed a Bear was trying to disengage himself 
from the rope, but the slip-knot about his wrist would not yield, 
for the Bear was all the time pulling in the slack with his paws.  
In the midst of his trouble the Hunter saw a Showman passing by, 
and managed to attract his attention.

  "What will you give me," he said, "for my Bear?"

  "It will be some five or ten minutes," said the Showman, "before I 
shall want a fresh Bear, and it looks to me as if prices would fall 
during that time.  I think I'll wait and watch the market."

  "The price of this animal," the Hunter replied, "is down to bed-
rock; you can have him for nothing a pound, spot cash, and I'll 
throw in the next one that I lasso.  But the purchaser must remove 
the goods from the premises forthwith, to make room for three man-
eating tigers, a cat-headed gorilla, and an armful of 
rattlesnakes."

  But the Showman passed on, in maiden meditation, fancy free, and 
being joined soon afterward by the Bear, who was absently picking 
his teeth, it was inferred that they were not unacquainted.
