   A POLITICAL Preferment, labelled with its price, was canvassing the 
State to find a purchaser.  One day it offered itself to a Truly 
Good Man, who, after examining the label and finding the price was 
exactly twice as great as he was willing to pay, spurned the 
Political Preferment from his door.  Then the People said: "Behold, 
this is an honest citizen!"  And the Truly Good Man humbly 
confessed that it was so.
